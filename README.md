This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Perl regular expressions involving matching digits within square brackets when the number of digits is variable.  The original code attempts to sum numbers enclosed in square brackets from a stream of input lines.  However, it fails to correctly match numbers with varying lengths.  The solution provided demonstrates a corrected regular expression to handle this case effectively.
